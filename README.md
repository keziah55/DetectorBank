# Detectorbank!

C++/Python software to detect note events using Hopf Bifurcations.

The full documentation, including [examples](https://keziah55.github.io/DetectorBank/PythonExamples.html) 
can be found [here](https://keziah55.github.io/DetectorBank/).

Materials relating to the development of the DetectorBank and the 
OnsetDetector can be found [here](https://github.com/keziah55/ExtraThesisMaterial).

This software is released under the terms of the 
[GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html);
if you wish to use it under different terms, get in touch and we'll sort 
something out.

## Requirements

On a Debian system, the following packages should be installed:

* python3-dev
* python3-numpy
* swig (to build python3 bindings)
* build-essential
* autoconf-archive
* libtool
* libcereal-dev
* librapidxml-dev
* libfftw3-dev
* doxygen (for the documentation)
* python3 (for the documentation as well as the SWIG bindings)
* graphviz (for enhanced documentation)
* python3-tap (for the unit tests)

### Debian/Ubuntu

```
apt install python3-dev python3-numpy swig build-essential autoconf-archive pkg-config libtool libcereal-dev librapidxml-dev libfftw3-dev doxygen python3 graphviz python3-tap
```

### Fedora

```
dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel python3-devel python3-numpy swig autoconf-archive libtool fftw-devel rapidxml-devel cereal-devel doxygen python3 graphviz
```

## Installation

You need to install apt install autoconf-archive for lovely
extra macros if you want this to build on debian.

Set up the build system if required

```
autoreconf --install --verbose
```

(or -iv).

We recommend you build the software to and install it from
a new directory.

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
../configure
make
```

Optionally build and run the unit tests

```
make check
```

Note that to run a single test, you can look in `tests/Makefile.am` then supply a replacement for TESTS naming
only those you wish to run, e.g.:

```
make check TESTS='Pytests'
```

The results of the checks are written in test/test-suite.log

```
sudo make install
```

On some platforms you may have to refresh the shared object cache:

```
sudo ldconfig
```

Perhaps also test that the library's been installed properly by asking
for the compilation flags

```
( cd ; pkg-config detectorbank --cflags --libs )
```

Documentation is built in the doxygen-doc subdirectory and installed
in $(docdir)/html. The default top page for the documentation is:

```
/usr/local/share/doc/detectorbank/html/index.html
```

If you don't want/need Python3 bindings generated by SWIG, you can
pass the `--without-swig` to the configure command. Note that Python3
is still required to build the library.

You can build for debugging by defining the C preprocesor macro DEBUG when
compiling. For example:

```
../configure CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG=2
```

in the example above.

DEBUG levels (can be |ed):

    1: Report thread start and end + general usage
    2: Write description of detector normalisation to /tmp/z.dat
       for search normalisation of stdout for chirp normalisation
    4: Log SlidingBuffer memory debugging info (LONG!)

Note that stuff gets printed when DEBUG == 0 (or simply exists).
For no debugging output, don't define it at all.

## Note Detection

Work-in-progress note detector using the DetectorBank can be found [here](https://github.com/keziah55/NoteDetector).
